{"name":"Michael McAuliffe","tagline":"Computational phonetician","body":"I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at McGill University working primarily with Morgan Sonderegger and Michael Wagner. I received my PhD from the University of British Columbia. My thesis was on lexically-guided perceptual learning and attention (available [here](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0166424), code available [here](https://github.com/mmcauliffe/mcauliffe-phd)). Much of my computational research on GitHub deals with speech sounds in spontaneous and laboratory speech, and in the ways that signal processing techniques can represent those sounds.\r\n\r\n## Primary projects\r\n\r\n### Speech Corpus Tools\r\n[Speech Corpus Tools](https://github.com/MontrealCorpusTools/speechcorpustools) is a graphical application for interacting, querying, and visualizing large speech corpora.  It parses a wide range of formats into a database, which allow for fast and consistent queries across different sources of corpora.  [PolyglotDB](https://github.com/MontrealCorpusTools/PolyglotDB) is the package responsible for the storage and database aspects.\r\n\r\n### python-acoustic-similarity\r\n[Python-acoustic-similary](https://github.com/mmcauliffe/python-acoustic-similarity) represents most of my work in signal processing for creating MFCC, amplitude envelope, and gammatone representations of speech.  Future versions will also include algorithms to calculate linguistically-relevant measurements such as pitch and formants.\r\n\r\n### Phonological CorpusTools\r\n[Phonological CorpusTools](https://github.com/PhonologicalCorpusTools/CorpusTools) has Python implementations of algorithms reported in the linguistic literature with the ability to run these algorithms on a wide variety of corpora.  The primary contributors to this project are Kathleen Currie Hall (@kchall), Blake Allen (@bhallen), Michael Fry (@mdfry), Scott Mackie (@jsmackie) and myself.","google":"UA-73068199-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
