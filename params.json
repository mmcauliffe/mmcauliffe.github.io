{"name":"Michael McAuliffe","tagline":"Computational phonetician","body":"I am a PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia in the Department of Linguistics.  Much of my computational research on GitHub deals with speech sounds in spontaneous and laboratory speech, and in the ways that signal processing techniques can represent those sounds.\r\n\r\n## Projects\r\n\r\n### python-acoustic-similarity\r\nThis Python package represents most of my work in signal processing for creating MFCC, amplitude envelope, and gammatone representations of speech.  Future versions will also include algorithms to calculate linguistically-relevant measurements such as pitch and formants.\r\n\r\n### exemplar-network-explorer\r\nThis project is a GUI interface for many of the algorithms used in the python-acoustic-similarity package, with an emphasis on clustering acoustic tokens using various representations and distance measures available in python-acoustic-similarity.\r\n\r\n### CorpusTools\r\nCorpusTools has Python implementations of algorithms reported in the linguistic literature with the ability to run these algorithms on a wide variety of corpora.  The primary contributors to this project are Kathleen Currie Hall (@kchall), Blake Allen (@bhallen), Michael Fry (@mdfry), Scott Mackie (@jsmackie) and myself.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
